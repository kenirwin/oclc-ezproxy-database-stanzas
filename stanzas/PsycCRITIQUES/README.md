## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

EBSCO's LinkSource requires EZproxy 2.0i (2003-03-09) or later.

EBSCO LinkSource requires the following configuration:

This database definition should appear in config.txt  before any other EBSCO database definitions.

The Title directive's -hide option was introduced in EZproxy 3.2a (2005-03-28) and suppresses the database definition from appearing in the generated menu. If you are using an older release of EZproxy, you should omit -hide.
