** This stanza needs manual review at [https://www.oclc.org/support/services/ezproxy/documentation/db/westlawchina.en.html](https://www.oclc.org/support/services/ezproxy/documentation/db/westlawchina.en.html) **

## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

Westlaw China requires EZproxy 4.0g (2007-03-12) (or later) combined with the following database definition for config.txt :

Please note that many functions of Westlaw China will only function properly if you disable any pop-up blocker. For example, printing may not work if a pop-up blocker is active.

When using versions of EZproxy prior to 4.0g, an error message that starts Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManagerParserErrorException can appear. If this occurs, the only way to resolve the problem is to upgrade to a current release of EZproxy.
