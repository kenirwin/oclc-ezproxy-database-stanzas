** This stanza needs manual review at [https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management/EZproxy/Database_stanzas/Westlaw_China](https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management/EZproxy/Database_stanzas/Westlaw_China) **

## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

Westlaw China requires EZproxy 4.0g (2007-03-12) or later.

Note: Many functions of Westlaw China will only function properly if you disable pop-up blockers. For example, printing may not work if a pop-up blocker is active.

When using versions of EZproxy prior to 4.0g, an error message that starts &quot;Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManagerParserErrorException&quot; may appear. If this occurs, the only way to resolve the problem is to upgrade to a current release of EZproxy.
