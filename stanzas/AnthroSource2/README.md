## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

If your config.txt file contains stanzas for both AnthroSource 2.0 and Wiley Online Library, make sure that the AnthroSource 2.0 stanza follows the Wiley Online Library stanza. This will ensure that processing of the Wiley Online Library stanza includes all processing directives but will not interfere with the processing of the AnthroSource 2.0 stanza.
