## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

Canadian Pharmacists Association products require EZproxy 3.2a (2005-03-28) or later along with the following database definitions in config.txt . You only need to include definitions that match products to which your institution subscribes. You must also perform SSL configuration to enable https proxying.

In these configurations, replace yourusername with your institution's username and yourpassword with your institution's password.

The starting point URLs for these database definitions will look like:

replacing ezproxy.yourlib.org:2048 with the name and port of your own EZproxy server.
