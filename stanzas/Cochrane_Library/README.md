## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

Cochrane Library requires SSL configuration and the following database stanza in config.txt :

If your config.txt file contains stanzas for both Cochrane Library and Wiley Online Library, make sure that the Cochrane Library stanza follows the Wiley Online Library stanza. This will ensure that processing of the Wiley Online Library stanza includes all processing directives in that stanza but will not interfere with the processing of the Cochrane Library stanza.
