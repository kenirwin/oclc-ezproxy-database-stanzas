## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

ProQuest requires EZproxy 6.2.2, SSL configuration and the following database stanza in config.txt :

Please note that previous versions of this stanza included the following line:

ProQuest has requested that EZproxy users not construct https Starting Point URLs on this domain (the OpenURL Gateway). The OpenURL gateway will remain on HTTP after ProQuest's https transition (July 2017) and will properly redirect to https://search.proquest.com after resolving the OpenURL.
