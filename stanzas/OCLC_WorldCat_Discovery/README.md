## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

This site employs TLS 1.2. EZproxy 6.2.2 is required to proxy this resource.

For every [my institution] in the stanza above, insert the institution used with your WorldCat Discovery instance. For [registry_id] above, insert your institution's registry ID.

Also add the following hidden stanza to allow the non-customized pieces of the IDM to be proxied as well as static scripts/images that support WorldCat Local but do not need to be customized. The URL in this stanza is irrelevant; it is only the presence of &quot;DJ worldcat.org&quot; that matters.
