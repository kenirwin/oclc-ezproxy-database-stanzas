## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

PubMed requires SSL Configuration and the following database definition in config.txt :
 

The URL line may be modified to point to your library's PubMed holdings if desired.
 
 The lines between DJ static.pubmed.gov and the Find/Replace lines are for linking hosts that are used to link from PubMed to content held in licensed databases. You may omit the linking host lines if they are not relevant to your needs.
 
 The linking lines for EBSCOhost that appeared in earlier definitions of PubMed were removed since the standard definition for EBSCOhost contains everything needed to insure that links from PubMed to EBSCOhost will be handled correctly.
