## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

&nbsp;July 2017: There were lines in SAGE&rsquo;s stanza that prevented videos in SAGE Research Methods and SAGE Knowledge from loading. At your earliest convenience, please remove the lines &ldquo;HJ brightcove.com&rdquo; and &ldquo;DJ brightcove.com&rdquo; from SAGE&rsquo;s stanza.

December 2017 update: The following two lines were added to the stanza to support the version of SAGE Journals hosted in China.
